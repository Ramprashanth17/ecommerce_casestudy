21 and 22 Feb:

Once the initial setup of DBT folder has done, now it is time for me to do the data transoformations to the data
based on the requirements. Initially, I charted out 3 requirements and will increment on it based on growing requirements
and use cases. This will also help in designing a scalabe data model and let me be flexible.

Here are the 3 initial business requirements:
Requirement 1: "I need to understand our revenue performance. How much are we making over time? Which product categories drive the most revenue? I want to see this monthly."
Requirement 2: "Our delivery experience is a problem. I need to know what percentage of orders are delivered late versus on time, and which states have the worst delivery performance."
Requirement 3: "I want to understand our customer base. How many customers do we have by state? What's the average order value? Are there customers who've ordered more than once?"

Instead of jumping right away, it is always the best to ask qualifying questions to get a clear cut idea on what exactly are the requirements, so that you don't assume
something you thought applicable, but the business team might thought otherwise. "Don't Assume, get Clarity!". 
By asking questions, you'll also cut off unwanted columns or data that may not add much value.

In this case, I asked the following questions to get a clear idea:

1. Performance: What exactly you mean by performance, how is it calculated? what are your metrics to measure the performance. 
2. In the 2nd requirement, it says they need to know states having worst delivery performance, is it the percentage of late deliveries to the on-time deliveries, review based performance?
3. Requirement 3 is fairly clear, but you can drill to know more about further requirements.
